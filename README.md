# MNIST Classification with Artificial Neural Nets

# About

This is an implementation of Artificial Neural Networks for classifying the MNIST dataset in Python, using numpy and matplotlib libraries. 
The motivation for implementing it from scratch was to learn more about the maths behind neural networks(and machine learning in general),
rather than it's application in real world problems.
